## $\textsf{\color{lightgreen} Description}$
This project was a promotional video for Awaaz at Duke University, an annual event celebrating South Asian culture and heritage. The theme for the 2023 Awaaz was "Awaaz Night Live," inspired by the iconic TV show "Saturday Night Live" (SNL). This video emulates the style of SNL intro videos to introduce the emcees of the Awaaz show and set the tone for the event. Awaaz, meaning "voice" in Hindi, is the largest student-run production at Duke, organized by Duke Diya. The event features a vibrant showcase of music, dance, comedy, and other performances, bringing together over 600 students from diverse backgrounds. Awaaz not only celebrates the rich traditions of South Asia but also raises awareness and funds for various charitable causes.
